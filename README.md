# Adapter Requests
This Place is used to track the status of Requests for new ioBroker-Adapters.

**Issues and problems with existing Adapters should be created as issues in the respective Adapter Repository.**

## How to use this?
* If you are interested in a new Adater for a new device or functionality then please create a new Issue (see below for information)
* If an issue is already existing use the "+1"/"Thumbs up" button to also show interest/vote for the topic. If you just created the issue or giving the first vote then you need to use the face-button in the upper right corner of the first post to select the thumbs-up. If already one vote is there you can just click on it to increase the number of votes.

## Why should I vote for issues?
... because the developers use this as information to see which Adapter is interesting for how many users ... but this is only one reason a developer starts development. So also less voted adapter requests could be done before others. It is still a decision from the developer!

## What information should the issue contain?
* The issue name should clearly contain the device or functionality
* In the issue description provide all information you was able to collect so far. Please include links to the manufactorer with information, datasheets, developer documentation, API specs
* If the topic was discussed in ioBroker forum please include the link too.
* Vote for yourself in the first post of the issue using the "+1"/"Thumbs up" button

## How developers should use it?
* If you want to develop a new Adapter please add your own ideas and adapters here too so that we have transparency
* Add a clear comment that you are planning or actively working on the adapter.
* The issue will be assigned to you soon afterwards.
* Add a link to the repository as soon as it exists and do not forget to register your adapter at npm. (*)
* Drop a note here if you released the adapter to testing (added a topic at https://forum.iobroker.net) and link to the forums topic
* Add the link to your repository PR as soon as you request addition to latest repository.
* Do NOT close the issue when the adapter or functionality is available - this will be done during repository release.

(*) Note: This repository and especially the issue list does NOT synchronize any adapter names. So the first one registering an adaptername at npm will succeed and noramlly have the right to publish an adapter with this name at ioBroker repositories.
